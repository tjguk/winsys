r"""Windows manages security by granting rights -- such as the
ability to read or write an object -- in the form of
Access Control Lists (ACLs) of Access Control Entries (ACEs)
to specific security principals: users, groups or other entities.
In addition, process security is managed by granting each logged-on
session a Token which contains the rights associated with that
session plus certain Privileges, such as the ability to take
ownership of any object or to access security-related data.

ACLs and ACEs are managed through the :class:`Security` object,
accessed mostly by means of the :func:`security` function, or
the :meth:`fs.Entry.security` method on external classes. Security
principals are represented by :class:`Principal` objects, accessed
via the :func:`principal` function. :class:`Privilege` objects
refer to process privileges and are reached through the :func:`principal`
function, or through the :attr:`Privileges` attribute of a :class:`Token`.

class Security (core._WinSysObject):
  r"""The heart of the :mod:`security` module, this class represents the security
  descriptor of a file, kernel object or any other securable object. It's most
  commonly instantiated from an object's security method (eg `fs.File.security`)
  or by means of the :func:`security` function which can take the name or handle
  of an object and return a corresponding :class:`Security` object.

  Key attributes are:

  * owner - a :class:`Principal` object representing the object owner
  * group - a :class:`Principal` object representing the object group
  * dacl - a :class:`security.DACL` object representing the DACL
  * sacl - an :class:`security.SACL` object representing the SACL

  of which group and sacl are less likely to be used (group hardly at all).
  These attributes are carefully-handled properties of the :class:`Security`
  object and are intended to make it very easy to manipulate the ACLs and
  ACEs of the Windows security model. The owner and group accept assignments
  of anything accepted by :func:`principal` while the ACL attributes accept
  anything accepted by :func:`acl`, in particular a list of :class:`ACE`
  entries, themselves anything accepted by :func:`ace`. So a very simple
  way to add the local administrator to the DACL with full control is::

    from winsys import security
    with security.security ("c:/temp/blah.txt") as s:
      s.dacl.append (("Administrator", "F", "ALLOW"))

  or to give only the logged-on user rights to a particular file
  while explicitly denying the local administrator::

    from winsys import security
    with security.security ("c:/temp/secret.txt") as s:
      s.dacl = [
        (security.me (), "F", "ALLOW"),
        ("Administrator", "F", "DENY")
      ]
      s.break_inheritance (copy_first=False)

  By default, only Owner and Group
  information is populated (although this can easily by changed by passing
  other options when creating the object). And only those objects which are
  populated, or explicitly requested will be updated when the security information
  is written back to the underlying object or handle.

  A :class:`Security` object is its own context handler and this is the most
  straightforward way to update security information, although the :meth:`Security.to_object`
  method will let you write the security information back to any arbitrary object,
  including the one it came from.

  For the purposes of serialisation, the standard SDDL format is used for
  strings and can be round-tripped between :meth:`as_string` and :meth:`from_string`.

  Finally, a string finds the security attributes for the object of that name.

  The most common use is to pass a filename. The :meth:`from_object` method
  assumes that an unqualified string represents a file. If it represents
  something else, you need to specify its type in the `obj_type` parameter::

    from winsys import security
    s = security.security ("c:/windows")
    s.dump ()

  :param obj: any of :const:`None`, a :class:`Security` object, a pywin32 :const:`PyHANDLE`,
              a pywin32 :const:`PySECURITY_DESCRIPTOR`, or a string
  :param obj_type: an :const:`SE_OBJECT_TYPE` [:const:`file_object`]
  :param options: anything acccepted by :meth:`security_options` [:const:`DEFAULT_OPTIONS`]
  :returns: a :class:`Security` object
  """
  if obj is None:
    return None
