class Mailslot(core._WinSysObject):
    """A mailslot is a mechanism for passing small datasets (up to about
    400 bytes) between machines in the same network. For transport and
    name resolution it uses NetBIOS so you can't, for example, use a
    machine's IP address when specifying the location of a mailslot.
    You can, however, use "*" in order to broadcast your message to
    all listening machines.

    A mailslot is either read-only or write-only. The typical case
    is that one machine starts up a reading mailslot, say for trace
    output, and all other machines write to that mailslot either by
    specifying the machine name directly or by broadcasting. This is
    particularly convenient as the writing machines have no need to
    determine where the trace-collecting mailslot is running or even
    if it is running at all.

    The format for mailslot names is \\\\<computer>\\mailslot\\<path>\\<to>\\<mailslot>
    The computer name can be "." for the local computer, a Windows
    computer name, a domain name, or an asterisk to indicate a broadcast.
    It's not necessary to have a complex path for the mailslot but it is
    supported and could be used to segregate functionally similar
    mailslots on the same or different machines.

    This class deliberately wraps the mailslot API in a Python
    API which is plug-compatible with that of the Python Queue
    mechanism with the following notes:

    * A mailslot is either read-only or write-only. Generally,
        the first action taken on it determines which it is, although
        remote mailslots can only be written to so this is predetermined.

    * A mailslot can be context-managed so that it is opened and
        closed correctly regardless of any errors.

    * A mailslot is its own iterator (strictly: generator)

    * By default the data through a mailslot is expected to be
        text, and is passed through untouched. Alternative
        serialisers can be provided, for example marshal.dumps and
        marshal.loads to allow simple objects to be transmitted via
        the mailslot. Note that the maximum message size still applies
        so it's not possible to send very complex datasets this way.

    Since a mailslot will always return immediately if passed to one
    of the Wait... functions, events or other synchronisation objects
    will be needed to coordinate between mailslots.
