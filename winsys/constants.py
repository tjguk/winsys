u"""Provide unified access to the different sets of constants used by
the winsys module. Some of them are provided by modules within the
pywin32 package. Others belong to those sets but are not present in
the modules. Still others are not present at all within pywin32 and
are added here manually.

The constants are grouped together into named Constants classes
which combine the effect of being a namespace and also providing
functions to list the constant name or names given a value, which
is useful when displaying Win32 structures.
